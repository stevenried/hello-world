# hello-world
GitHub hello world project. My first repo.

Steven here. So new to any of this Git/GitHub stuff. It all seems so weird to me, so unnecesary. Superfluous! I just don't get the need. What's wrong with copies of files you make yourself? I'm hoping that, with time and experience, I can learn to appreciate the value of all this.
